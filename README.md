# Description

This project is a work-in-progress. The goal is to create a script that can extract financial data from various sources such as bank statements and credit card statements. The extracted data will then be organized and written into an xlsx file using multiple formats for effective visualization. The script should offer extensive customization options to users, allowing them to create personalized categories for transaction parsing and customizing the appearance of the resulting xlsx file, including styles and formatting.
